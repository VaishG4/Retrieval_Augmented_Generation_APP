# Retrieval_Augmented_Generation_APP
Built a production RAG pipeline for semantic search and Q&amp;A over enterprise datasets using LangChain and OpenAI APIs, with embeddings and source attribution to ensure explainability. • Owned the lifecycle from prototype to deployed service (pilot → monitoring → iteration), reducing operator query time and improving answer trustworthiness.
